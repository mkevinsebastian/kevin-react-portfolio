        I'm Master of Computer Science students at Bina Nusantara University with a strong passion for building scalable and
        high-performing applications. My expertise spans full-stack development, encompassing practical knowledge of
        database, front-end, and back-end technologies.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">About Me</h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Currently, as an Application Developer at PT Infracom Technology, I'm actively developing end-to-end
        application solutions using the Mendix platform, crafting responsive user interfaces with ReactJS/NextJS, and
        building robust back-end services with FastAPI.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        My foundational experience includes a valuable tenure as a Global Custom Application Support Intern at PT
        Freeport Indonesia. In this role, I was responsible for debugging and optimizing enterprise applications
        across multiple layers, utilizing .NET Core, Microsoft SQL Server, and Microsoft Azure. This experience
        significantly enhanced my capacity to handle challenging system issues and ensure flawless application
        performance.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        Beyond my professional roles, I've deepened my expertise in cross-platform development by creating a
        Flutter-based mobile application with Supabase for my thesis. I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, and have a
        solid understanding of core programming concepts in C, Java, and Python. I am constantly keen to learn new
        things and actively investigate cutting-edge technologies like React Native and continue to hone my skills
        in data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming.
